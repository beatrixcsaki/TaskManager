# TaskManager 

This is a Java Application in which we receive as input a list of dependencies (e.g. A->B) and we have to print them in different ordering methods (strong dependency, weak dependency, hierarchical order) based on alphabetical sorting, availability, successors, predecessors. Our solution was to develop three algorithms, one for each sorting method, using as main design pattern the Iterator Pattern.
